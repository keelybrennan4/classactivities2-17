# classactivities2-17
Class make-up activities from Saturday, 2/17/18

Brief Summary:
I loved Tish’s analogy of scope being like your yard/house/bedroom — I didn’t realize scope was the issue I was having in my homework, so I didn’t even think to google/ask about it, but this really made sense and help me address the issues I had in my homework (which I’ll go back and update).

Activities 13 - 15 cleared up some confusion I was having with scope and “this”.
The property on an object can use “this” to access the object, however, “this” in a function is in the global scope, so nested functions can still access variables defined in the global scope (unlike objects).

The majority of class was spent on the calculator activity. The 3 phase approach with micro-objectives helped guide me in the level of pseudo code needed, and will absolutely help me with my approach to pseudo coding going forward.
